This challenge was from the Hack the Box Business CTF and was a malware analysis kind. When reversing, I tend not to focuss too deeply on what's is really going on and only look towards what can be useful. Renaming functions and variables, deobfuscation and doing a good work is not something that matters during a CTF; we only need the flag. Thus, why reverse engineer when you don't have too? The less we reverse, the better it is.

## Quick look
We are given 3 files; a pcap, a PE file and an encrypted PDF. We will need to reverse engineer the PE file, decrypt the traffic and then decrypt the PDF. Let's start off by doing a `string` command on the PE file. The pcap contains only TCP communications and it is also encrypted.

```
[...]
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.OpenKey
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.Key.getValue
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.Key.GetStringValue
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.Key.setValue
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.Key.setStringValue
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.regSetValueEx
golang.org/x/sys/windows/registry.init
main.main
main.rzSF37vf8khc8Vye
main.g7Srk53hUCFt86bQ

```

So, we will need to deal with a binary wrritten in Golang, and that's probably something we don't want. Launching IDA, we can find all the `main.*` functions. We can quickly open them all and check wether they worth a closer look. We can find two functions calling `crypto_aes_NewCipher` and `crypto_cipher_newGCMWithNonceAndTagSize`. There's a hardcoded key, `12345612345612345612345612345612` and we can try to decrypt what's inside the pcap.

``` python
from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
import binascii

key = "12345612345612345612345612345612"
ciphers = ["b00347dee4399de165d65fde63efcc30786c4190186a13442e8a8bc6f2272819701ca86c",
		"d738b57fa4e3271a0acddf5279dc596e0f9673092a2fb9c1f00ef81111dfb4377624acc3f47b889997a8b43bb8af",
		"ee28ef0ddf01ff82d7436465e1b1b5df843b7679e44253a0bd6a7afeb8c53a309774"]

for cipher in ciphers:
	data = binascii.unhexlify(cipher)
	nonce, tag = data[:12], data[-16:]
	cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce)
	cleartext = cipher.decrypt_and_verify(data[12:-16], tag)
	print(cleartext)
```

.
	
``` sh
$ python2 decrypt_pcap.py 
yOaw1fs6
megacorp\rashley

WS02
```

We can bot decrypt what was sent to the Command and Control (CnC) server (hexadecimal communications in red) and what was sent by it (in blue). There's a big chunk of blue and when decrypted is actually another PE file, beginning with `0xa2bb3d872360`.

## Encryptor

This decrypted PE file is written in .dotnet, and therefore easier to analyze, although the other binary wasn't a problem so far. 

At first glance, there's a function called `s2T4rbNt4JPA6DeM` that encrypts things and write them into files. The function `x3bMQH27hJEt2sz8` is the only one calling `s2T4rbNt4JPA6DeM`, and it passes filenames as a parameter and the encryption key. The encrypted key is generate like so: `Guid.NewGuid().ToString();`. When decrypting the network traffic, we found a Guid, so we will use this one. Strings used through the binary are encrypted via a xor key, in the function `nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ` and this xor key comes from `arg[0]`. Having no idea what the xor key can be, we can look what's calling this function. We will find this oone.

``` c#
private static void whJa4rDSBHveMmfj(string value)
{
	string str = umj3VnYEF8fY3bkw.nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ("CRg7LjVkJgAjdi1rBhg5PBw=", true);
	string str2 = umj3VnYEF8fY3bkw.nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ(
			"HQARER5QEiAUby5WOj8FCiFVBmAhXUY0Dy8TPRUdJAwlA0pyJCENHgVJLwUYXQdQLj4/CSpSBlk=",
					true);
	Registry.SetValue(str + str2, umj3VnYEF8fY3bkw.nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ("FCMaFh5CODcI", true), value);
}
```

The function `Registry.SetValue` will modify the registry. It needs, as parameters, the name/value pair. Looking on MSDN (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.win32.registry.setvalue?view=net-5.0), we find this:

> Valid root names include HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_USERS, HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, and HKEY_DYN_DATA.

Now knowing both the encrypted and the clear texts, we can find the encryption key, or at least, a part of it.

``` python
cleartext = "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
cipher = str("CRg7LjVkJgAjdi1rBhg5PBw=".decode('base64'))
cipher += str("HQARER5QEiAUby5WOj8FCiFVBmAhXUY0Dy8TPRUdJAwlA0pyJCENHgVJLwUYXQdQLj4/CSpSBlk=".decode('base64'))

key = ""
for i in range(0, len(cleartext)):
    for j in range(0, 255):
        c = ord(cipher[i]) ^ j
        if c == ord(cleartext[i]):
            key += chr(j)
print("key:", key)

ct = ""
for i in range(0, len(cipher)):
    c = ord(cipher[i]) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])
    ct += chr(c)
print(buf)
```
.
``` sh
$ python2 dec_srings.py
('key:', "AS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyN")
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MicrosoUV7aG
```

We successfully decrypted a part of the string and we can guess some more: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft`. Adding this part to our `cleartext` lead to more decryption.

``` sh
$ python2 dec_strings.py
('key:', "AS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyNAS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyN3r")
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft!r#1^(\AL&~hi3<ersion\WindowsUpdat
```

Looking up at the Windows registry, we can guess the remaining missing text: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate`. Running again, we recover the full encryption key, `AS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyNAS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyN3r<v4(P`X`aVhV~@m>$AS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyN3r<`. We now have everything needed to decrypt anything that was encrypted by the .dotnet binary.

The encryption function looks like this.

``` c#
private static void s2T4rbNt4JPA6DeM(string yr9Zavw65pKUDrxZ, string PFEFqXuurH3zqxNp)
{
	byte[] array = umj3VnYEF8fY3bkw.GWW79N5ekj2aMunb();
	FileStream fileStream = new FileStream(
					yr9Zavw65pKUDrxZ + umj3VnYEF8fY3bkw.nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ("bzQWGBlT", true),
						FileMode.Create);
	byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(PFEFqXuurH3zqxNp);
	RijndaelManaged rijndaelManaged = new RijndaelManaged();
	rijndaelManaged.KeySize = 256;
	rijndaelManaged.BlockSize = 128;
	rijndaelManaged.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
	Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(bytes, array, 50000);
	rijndaelManaged.Key = rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(rijndaelManaged.KeySize / 8);
	rijndaelManaged.IV = rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(rijndaelManaged.BlockSize / 8);
	rijndaelManaged.Mode = CipherMode.CFB;
	fileStream.Write(array, 0, array.Length);
	CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(fileStream,
						rijndaelManaged.CreateEncryptor(),
						CryptoStreamMode.Write);
	FileStream fileStream2 = new FileStream(yr9Zavw65pKUDrxZ, FileMode.Open);
	byte[] array2 = new byte[1024];
	try
	{
		int count;
		while ((count = fileStream2.Read(array2, 0, array2.Length)) > 0)
		{
			cryptoStream.Write(array2, 0, count);
		}
		fileStream2.Close();
	}
	catch (Exception)
	{
		return;
	}
	finally
	{
		cryptoStream.Close();
		fileStream.Close();
	}
	File.Delete(yr9Zavw65pKUDrxZ);
}
```

To recap, we have the xor key to generate the encryption key from the Guid, the IV is added to the beginning of every encrypted files. The remaining part is to create the decryption function and this can be done by changing `rijndaelManaged.CreateEncryptor()` to `rijndaelManaged.CreateDecryptor()`. Our final decryption function will look like this.

``` c#
public static string nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ(string FjzAXMdCE8cSHttD, bool cSHsdasdqwttD = true)
{
	byte[] PFEFqXuurH3zqxNp = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("AS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyN3r<v4(P`X`aVhV~@m>$AS~wj'sRq3c?YMjyN3r<")

	byte[] array;
	if (cSHsdasdqwttD)
	{
		array = Convert.FromBase64String(FjzAXMdCE8cSHttD);
	}
	else
	{
		array = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(FjzAXMdCE8cSHttD);
	}
	Console.WriteLine(array.Length);
	StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
	for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
	{
		stringBuilder.Append((char)(array[i] ^ PFEFqXuurH3zqxNp[i % PFEFqXuurH3zqxNp.Length]));
	}
	return stringBuilder.ToString();
}

public static void s2T4rbNt4JPA6DeM()
{
	// first 32 bytes taken from Confidential.pdf.ghost
	byte[] array = { 0x9d, 0xa4, 0xef, 0x14, 0xa1, 0xfc, 0xa3, 0xfa, 0xcb, 0x31, 0x70, 0xd9,
	 		0x43, 0xf4, 0x62, 0x7f, 0xa5, 0xb2, 0xbd, 0xb6, 0x44, 0x69, 0x5d, 0x65,
			0xfe, 0x57, 0xa8, 0xb5, 0x90, 0xf1, 0x08, 0x5a };
	FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("confidential.pdf.ghost", FileMode.Create);
	byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(nVw6FkXDzmwHwVWZ("d31dd518-8614-4162-beae-7a5a2ad86cc6", false));
	RijndaelManaged rijndaelManaged = new RijndaelManaged();
	rijndaelManaged.KeySize = 256;
	rijndaelManaged.BlockSize = 128;
	rijndaelManaged.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
	Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(bytes, array, 50000);
	rijndaelManaged.Key = rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(rijndaelManaged.KeySize / 8);
	rijndaelManaged.IV = rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(rijndaelManaged.BlockSize / 8);
	rijndaelManaged.Mode = CipherMode.CFB;
	fileStream.Write(array, 0, array.Length);
	CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(fileStream,
					rijndaelManaged.CreateDecryptor(),
					CryptoStreamMode.Write);
	FileStream fileStream2 = new FileStream("confidential.pdf", FileMode.Open);
	byte[] array2 = new byte[1024];
	try
	{
		int count;
		while ((count = fileStream2.Read(array2, 0, array2.Length)) > 0)
		{
			cryptoStream.Write(array2, 0, count);
		}
		fileStream2.Close();
	}
	catch (Exception)
	{
		return;
	}
	finally
	{
		cryptoStream.Close();
		fileStream.Close();
	}
}
```

## Wrap up
As seen in this write-up, we didn't reverse engineer that much; we spent only a few minutes on the Golang binary. This binary was reading commands to execute through a socket, and there's was a switch case based on what was sent by the CnC (see the function `main_rzSF37vf8khc8Vye`). It could launch a process, write to the Windows registry, execute in-memory assemblies, etc. Was this relevent to solve the challenge? Not at all!
