## About
I'm Nicolas Lamoureux, a pentester currently working at Latacora. We do security for startups. I've been into information security since 2014, and was a developper for embedded systems before.
My main interests are pentesting web applications and reverse engineering.

## Theme
I'm using the Monochrome theme and you can find it here: [Monochrome on Github](https://github.com/thereviewindex/monochrome/).
